This is the first release as part of Vox Pupuli.

This module is derrived from [falcosecurity/evolution](https://github.com/falcosecurity/evolution/tree/33a3025d1dedc3a6fbea814b8f3f80d275d6e3f0/integrations/puppet-module/falco). That code came from [falcosecurity/falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco) as part of resolving issue https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/1114. The old code is the basis for [sysdig/falco](https://forge.puppet.com/modules/sysdig/falco). https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/issues/2005 was submitted to request that module be depreciated since it appears to be abandoned.

The v1.0.0 release includes an overhaul of the code to make everything work and bring it up to current coding standards. It also incorporates all the change needed as part of migrating a module to Vox Pupuli.

**Breaking changes:**

- Rework module post-fork [\#1](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-falco/pull/1) ([genebean](https://github.com/genebean))

**Fixed bugs:**

- Fix default value for program\_output [\#6](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-falco/pull/6) ([genebean](https://github.com/genebean))

**Closed issues:**

- Falco crashes due to formatting error in config file [\#7](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-falco/issues/7)
- Update metadata.json to reflect transfer to Vox Pupuli [\#2](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-falco/issues/2)

**Merged pull requests:**

- Add missing files, update metadata post-migration [\#3](https://github.com/voxpupuli/puppet-falco/pull/3) ([genebean](https://github.com/genebean))
